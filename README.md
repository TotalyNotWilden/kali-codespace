this used docker so u can use a full kali linux terminal in github codespaces
if u choose 2 vCPUS u get 30 hours a month of free runtime, which spread evenely, is 1 hour a day, which is quite a lot

this is for people like me who dont have enough storage (or processing power) on their computers to run a full wsl
this isnt the most powerful but its good enough

 really dont care if u use this for yourself
 it comes preinstalled with nmap and sqlmap cause why not
 if something goes wrong find the nearest erson and scream at them for literally no reaon
 this wont make youfeel better but it gives that person emotional trauma which is better
 just do it
